# hello-world
I am a Full Stack Developer student with InceptionU. I am pursuing full-stack software development so that I can combine it with my exisiting interest in geopolitics, journalism, and ethical knowledge sharing. Not only to report on the world, but to actively shape how information is shared and preserved.
